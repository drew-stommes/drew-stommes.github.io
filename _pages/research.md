I primarily study how violence and democracy intersect, drawing on empirical evidence from South Asia. My dissertation/book project conceptualizes "armed political parties" and theorizes the microfoundations of their violence. Other studies examine the effects of democratic reforms (e.g. quotas for marginalized groups) during civil war and the myriad "wartime political parties" which contest elections during insurgent conflicts. This strand of research relies heavily on mixed-methods research designs and novel quantitative/qualitative evidence from South Asia.

A second strand of research explores increasingly-popular quantitative methods in political science, such as the regression discontinuity design. One study investigates the reliability of published political science research employing the regression discontinuity design, and another study derives a principled, data-driven case selection procedure for regression discontinuity studies aiming to integrate qualitative evidence.
