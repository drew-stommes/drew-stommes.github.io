[Descriptive Representation and Conflict Reduction: Evidence from India's Maoist Rebellion](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gfh3m)

*Joint work with Aidan Milliff.*

Can greater inclusion in democracy for historically-disadvantaged groups reduce rebelviolence? Democracy­building is a common tool of modern counterinsurgencies, despite so-far limited evidence about whether and how during-conflict institutional reforms mitigateviolence. We evaluate whether quotas for Scheduled Tribes in local councils reduced rebelviolence in two Maoist insurgency-affected Indian states, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Weemploy a geographic regression discontinuity design to study the effects of identical quotas inthe two states, finding that reservations reduced Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh, but yield aprecisely­estimated null effect in neighboring Jharkhand. Based on qualitative evidence fromChhattisgarh, we argue that quotas reduce violence when they bring local elected officialscloser to state security forces, providing a windfall of valuable information tocounterinsurgents. Our study shows how institutional engineering can alter the politicaleconomy of information provision, which in turn can shape the trajectory of a conflict.
