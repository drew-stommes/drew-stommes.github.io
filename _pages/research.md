Civil Wartime Political Parties: Evidence from Four Rebellions in India. *Under Review*. 
 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Political parties contest elections during civil wars, yet existing research does not sufficiently describe these parties nor evaluate the consequences of their electoral performance for democracy. This study conceptualizes wartime parties based on their position along the conflict’s master cleavage and whether they support the long-term persistence of existing democratic institutions. Among these parties, those exhibiting overlap with insurgents' ideology and supportive of existing democratic institutions uniquely face pressures from counterinsurgents and rebels. Regression discontinuity analyses and qualitative evidence from four civil wars in India demonstrate that counterinsurgents and rebels intensified operations and threats in regions where these aligned parties were electorally successful, significantly reducing subsequent voter turnout. However, analyses indicate that no wartime party types reap an incumbency advantage vis-\'a-vis other parties or relative to their peacetime performance. The findings suggest the importance of political parties in understanding wartime democracy and the limits of wartime polarization.

[Descriptive Representation and Conflict Reduction: Evidence from India's Maoist Rebellion](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gfh3m). (with Aidan Milliff). *Under Review*.

Can greater inclusion in democracy for historically-disadvantaged groups reduce rebel violence? Democracy-building is a common tool of modern counterinsurgencies, despite so-far limited evidence about whether and how during-conflict institutional reforms mitigate violence. We evaluate whether quotas for Scheduled Tribes in local councils reduced rebel violence in two Maoist insurgency-affected Indian states, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. We employ a geographic regression discontinuity design to study the effects of identical quotas in the two states, finding that reservations reduced Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh, but yield a precisely-estimated null effect in neighboring Jharkhand. Based on qualitative evidence from Chhattisgarh, we argue that quotas reduce violence when they bring local elected officials closer to state security forces, providing a windfall of valuable information to counterinsurgents. Our study shows how institutional engineering can alter the political economy of information provision, which in turn can shape the trajectory of a conflict.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
National and state-level security forces across India operate against insurgents, criminals, and external threats. These operations are politically consequential, yet these forces tend to be quite opaque. This article provides new data on the fatalities that these forces have suffered in order to explore the location and nature of political violence in India. We create several new datasets of security force fatalities extracted from commemorative security force “martyrs” documents and online databases published by Indian state-level police organizations, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and the Ministry of Defence, as well as semi-official sources. The data vary wildly in quality and detail, and there are serious limits to their use. Nevertheless, they allow us to – with caveats – measure the location and incidence of violence, as well as the demographic underpinnings of the Indian Army, the two largest MHA paramilitaries, and several state police forces. Caveats aside, we anticipate that subsets of these data are sufficiently high in quality, facilitating future rigorous quantitative analysis on political violence in India. The entire dataset will be made publicly available.
