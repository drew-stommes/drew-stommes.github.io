My primary research program addresses the myriad ways democracy and violent conflict intersect. One line of work investigates "armed political parties" and their patterns of violence, and another explores how democratic reforms and election outcomes affect violence and popular participation in democracy during civil wars.

A second strand of research explores how we can improve the application of increasingly-popular quantitative methods such as the regression discontinuity design.
