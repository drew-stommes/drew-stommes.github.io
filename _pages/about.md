I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Yale University, where I study democratic institutions and conflict in South Asia as well as quantitative methods. During the 2018-19 academic year, I completed an advanced Bangla language training program at the American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS) in Kolkata, India.

In 2015, I received an M.A. in International Relations from the University of Chicago, and in 2013, I received a B.A. from Saint John's University (Minnesota) where I majored in political science.
