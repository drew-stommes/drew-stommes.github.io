Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Yale University, where I research democracy, political violence, and quantitative methods. I have a regional specialization in South Asia --- the region that includes India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka --- and during the 2018-19 academic year, I completed an advanced Bangla language training program at the American Institute of Indian Studies in Kolkata, India.
