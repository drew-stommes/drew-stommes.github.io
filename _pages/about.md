Welcome --- I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Yale University, where I research democracy, political violence, and quantitative methods. I have a regional specialization in South Asia (the region that includes India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), and during the 2018-19 academic year, I completed an advanced Bangla language training program at the American Institute of Indian Studies in Kolkata, India. I am a graduate affiliate of the Yale South Asian Studies Council, and I currently serve as the graduate student coordinator for the CSAP-MacMillan Quantitative Research Methods Workshop at Yale.

I primarily study how violence and democracy intersect, drawing on empirical evidence from South Asia. My dissertation/book project conceptualizes “armed political parties” and theorizes the microfoundations of their violence. Other studies examine the effects of democratic reforms (e.g. quotas for marginalized groups) during civil war and the myriad “wartime political parties” which contest elections during insurgent conflicts. I rely primarily on mixed-methods designs and novel quantitative and qualitative evidence from South Asia.

A second strand of research explores increasingly-popular quantitative methods in political science. One study investigates the reliability of published political science research employing the regression discontinuity design, and another study derives a principled, data-driven case selection procedure for regression discontinuity studies aiming to integrate qualitative evidence.
